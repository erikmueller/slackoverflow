I ❤️ functional, declarative and clean programming and its powerful abstractions like pure functions and immutable data.
It makes programs easier to read and reason about. It also reduces cognitive load and brings the bug count down.
My favourite Tech-Stack consists of a `React`-based frontend, neatly bundled and transpiled to use the latest ECMA features.
I also love `Node.js` bundled with `TypeScript` in the backend but prefer the `BEAM` with `Elixir` or `Gleam` for its more functional nature.

## Technical Experience

**JavaScript & TypeScript** experience working professionally since 2013, extending existing architectures and conceptualizing new projects. Besides working with modern language features I utilised popular frameworks and libraries in production such as:

- React(-Native) and redux on client, server, and mobile
- Two popular node.js web frameworks: Express and Fastify
- ORM/ODM wrappers for mongodb (mongoose) and mysql (sequelize)
- Build tools and transpilers: Webpack, Metro, babel, Esbuild
- Several test frameworks and assertion libraries (jest, unexpected, karma, mocha, playwright)

I also created <i class="fab fa-github"></i> and contributed <i class="fas fa-code-branch"></i> to several open source projects including:

- <i class="fas fa-code-branch"></i> [eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint){target="blank"} (pluggable tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript)
- <i class="fas fa-code-branch"></i> [react-stdio](https://github.com/mjackson/react-stdio){target="blank"} (render React.js components on any backend)
- <i class="fab fa-github"></i> [cond-flow](https://github.com/erikmueller/cond-flow){target="blank"} (Inspired by Elixir's cond for functional data flow)
- <i class="fab fa-github"></i> [unexpected-immutable](https://github.com/erikmueller/unexpected-immutable){target="blank"} (immutable.js assertions for unexpected.js)
- <i class="fab fa-github"></i> [an-old-hype](https://github.com/erikmueller/an-old-hype){target="blank"} (port of an atom syntax theme for hyper)

**Elixir**. Hobby alchemist since 2016. Although still being a niche language Elixir helped me in becoming a better programmer and made me rethink established object oriented ways of thinking and programming patterns. A lot of the functional paradigms found in Elixir can be applied to the JavaScript language as well. I was part of the Hamburg.ex user group and created several side projects and playgrounds:

- <i class="fab fa-github"></i> [Luke](https://github.com/erikmueller/luke){target="blank"} (server-side rendered react-router with the cowboy webserver)
- <i class="fab fa-github"></i> [JellyShot](https://github.com/erikmueller/jelly_shot){target="blank"} (blog engine based on Phoenix powered by markdown)
- <i class="fab fa-github"></i> [Edmin](https://github.com/erikmueller/edmin){target="blank"} (image slider backed by ex_admin CRUD interface)
- <i class="fab fa-github"></i> [JAZ_ex_treme](https://github.com/erikmueller/jaz_ex_treme){target="blank"} (sorts different heat pump's SCOPs based on flow and return temps &amp; for efficiency)

**HTML & CSS**. Besides efficient JavaScript I consider writing semantically correct markup and stylesheets the bread and butter of successful web development.

**SQL & MongoDB**. Experience with running relational and document-oriented databases in production gives me the proficiency to chose the best technology for the job.

**Docker & CI/CD**. I use Docker a lot. Be it for easy reproducible deployments or faster development workflows. I also did docker multistage builds in the CI environment as well as bundle optimizations like code and route splitting.
