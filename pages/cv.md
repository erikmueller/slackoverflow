I ❤️ functional, declarative and clean programming and its powerful abstractions like pure functions and immutable data.
It makes programs easier to reason about and (imho) introduces less bugs.
My favourite Tech-Stack consists of a `React` frontend, bundled and transpiled with `webpack` to use the latest ES7 features.
I also love `node.js` bundled with `TypeScript` (when applicable) for the backend but prefer the `Elixir` environment around the `Phoenix` framework for its more functional nature.

## Technical Experience

**JavaScript** with 6 years professional experience in extending existing architectures as well as conceptualizing new projects. Besides working with ES6 and ES7 language features I utilised popular frameworks and libraries in production such as:

- React, redux and react-router on client and server (universal)
- Two popular node.js web frameworks: Express and hapi
- ORM/ODM wrappers for mongodb (mongoose) and mysql (sequelize)
- Build tools and transpilers: Webpack, babel and TypeScript (in conjuction)
- Several test runners and assertion libraries (jest, unexpected, karma, mocha, selenium)

I also created <i class="fab fa-github"></i> and contributed <i class="fas fa-code-branch"></i> to several open source projects including:

- <i class="fas fa-code-branch"></i> [eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint){target="blank"} (pluggable tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript)
- <i class="fas fa-code-branch"></i> [react-stdio](https://github.com/mjackson/react-stdio){target="blank"} (render React.js components on any backend)
- <i class="fab fa-github"></i> [unexpected-immutable](https://github.com/erikmueller/unexpected-immutable){target="blank"} (immutable.js assertions for unexpected.js)
- <i class="fab fa-github"></i> [an-old-hype](https://github.com/erikmueller/an-old-hype){target="blank"} (port of an atom syntax theme for hyper)

**Elixir**. Hobby alchemist for 2 years. Although still being a niche language Elixir helped me in becoming a better programmer and made me rethink established object oriented ways of thinking and programming patterns. A lot of the functional paradigms found in Elixir can be applied to the JavaScript language as well. I was part of the Hamburg.ex user group and created several side projects and playgrounds:

- <i class="fab fa-github"></i> [Luke](https://github.com/erikmueller/luke){target="blank"} (server-side rendered react-router with the cowboy webserver)
- <i class="fab fa-github"></i> [JellyShot](https://github.com/erikmueller/jelly_shot){target="blank"} (blog engine based on Phoenix powered by markdown)
- <i class="fab fa-github"></i> [Edmin](https://github.com/erikmueller/edmin){target="blank"} (image slider backed by ex_admin CRUD interface)

**HTML & CSS**. Besides efficient JavaScript I consider writing semantically correct markup and stylesheets the bread and butter of successful web development.

**MySQL & MongoDB**. Experience with running relational and document-oriented databases in production gives me the proficiency to always chose the best-fitting technology for the task at hand.

**Docker & CI**. I use Docker a lot. Be it for easy reproducible deployments or faster development workflows. All my projects build and test on [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/erikmueller). I also did docker multistage builds in the CI environment as well as bundle optimizations like code and route splitting.
